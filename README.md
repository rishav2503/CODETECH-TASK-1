# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT: Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program should allow the user to input a temperature in one scale and output the converted
         temperature in another scale.


## Temperature Conversion Program

This is a simple C++ program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The user can input a temperature in one scale and get the converted temperature in another scale.

KEY ACTIVITIES
         - Converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
         - Converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin.
         - Converts temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

         - A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)


## PLATFORM USED FOR CODING
          -VISUAL STDIO CODE


## OUTPUT PROCEDURE
          Steps
          1. Enter the temperature: The program will prompt you to enter the temperature you want to convert.
          2. Select the input scale: The program will ask you to choose the scale of the input temperature:
             1 for Celsius
             2 for Fahrenheit
             3 for Kelvin
          3. Select the output scale: The program will ask you to choose the scale to convert the temperature to:
             1 for Celsius
             2 for Fahrenheit
             3 for Kelvin
          4. Get the result: The program will display the converted temperature.
